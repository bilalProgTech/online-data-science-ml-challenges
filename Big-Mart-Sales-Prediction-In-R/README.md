# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction-In-R
Each product has certain attributes that sets it apart from other products and this is case in each store. <br/>
The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales. <br/>
Data used for the study is of Big Mart Sales for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013.
